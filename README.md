# Chatbot with python

![alt text](https://cdn.technologyadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/friendly-chatbot-700x408.jpg)

I used Python to build this simple chatbot that will be able to understand what the user is talking about and give an appropriate response.

To implement this thing, I'd used ***Keras***(Keras is a neural networks library written in Python) , ***NLTK*** - Natural LAanguage Toolkit and some libraries.

We can break down this process of building the chatbot into 5 steps :-
***1) Import libraries and load the data.
***2) Preprocessing the data.
***3) Create training and testing data.
***4) Training the model.
***5) Interact with the chatbot.
